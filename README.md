# About

This repository is the archive of personal modified version of NSIS 3.11. The changes are minor, mainly removing commands that I consider outdated or unnecessary, or enhancing commands that I consider weak.

## Changes

  * Remove `SubCaption`, and also `Caption` between `PageEx` & `PageExEnd`.<br/>
    All related code & strings has been completely removed.
